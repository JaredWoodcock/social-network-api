# Social Network API
Module 18 - NoSQL Challenge - Social Network API

In this challenge, I built an API for a social network application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friends list. 

<ul>When the user enters the command to invoke the application, then the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.</ul>
<ul>When the user opens API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.</ul>
<ul>When the user tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then they are able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the database.</ul>
<ul>When the user tests API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then they are able to successfully create and delete reactions and thoughts and add or remove friends to a user's friend list.</ul>
